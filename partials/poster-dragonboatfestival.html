        A poster designed for
        <strong>
          the Taiwanese Society of Oklahoma’s Dragon Boat Festival event</strong
        >. The theme blends
        <strong> “talent showcase x traditional celebration </strong>,”
        illustrated in a playful, child-like style that captures the festive
        spirit and cultural gathering of the Dragon Boat Festival. The
        composition centers on a bamboo steamer filled with rice dumplings,
        reimagined as a stage—symbolizing inclusiveness, unity, and the passing
        on of cultural heritage.
